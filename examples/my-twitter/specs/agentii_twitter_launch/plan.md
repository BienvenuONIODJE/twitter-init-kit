## VIII. Risk Management & Contingencies

### Risk 1: Benchmark Contested or Criticized
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High (credibility damage)

**Mitigation:**
- Make methodology completely transparent and peer-reviewable
- Prepare detailed response addressing common critiques
- Have academic advisors review benchmark
- Plan quarterly updates to address feedback

**Contingency:**
- If benchmark is criticized: Publish "Benchmark Methodology Q&A" post
- If accuracy is disputed: Offer independent verification by third party
- If competitors claim higher accuracy: Publish head-to-head evaluation

### Risk 2: Low Demo Conversion from Twitter Traffic
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium (wrong channel for activation)

**Mitigation:**
- Ensure Twitter CTAs align with audience needs (Demo vs. Trial)
- Test different CTAs (A/B across similar audiences)
- Make demo booking frictionless (direct link in bio)
- Track source of demo requests carefully

**Contingency:**
- If conversion <10%: Review CTA messaging, adjust to audience preference
- If conversion <5%: Pivot strategy away from direct CTAs toward content/community
- If conversion 0%: Question whether Twitter is right channel (pivot to LinkedIn)

### Risk 3: Founder Burnout (Too Much Content)
**Probability:** High | **Impact:** High (consistency suffers)

**Mitigation:**
- Set realistic cadence: 5-7 posts weekly, 3-5 replies daily max
- Batch content creation (2-3 hours on Sunday for entire week)
- Get support from team (someone manages replies while Frank writes)
- Schedule tweets to spread load across time zones

**Contingency:**
- If burnout signals appear: Reduce posting to 3-4x weekly, focus on quality
- If consistency drops: Hire social media manager to handle replies
- If quality degrades: Take 1-2 weeks off, maintain only high-value posts

### Risk 4: Competitive Response
**Probability:** High | **Impact:** Medium (attention diluted)

**Mitigation:**
- Own "reliability-driven AI" narrative early (hard for others to copy)
- Build defensible moat through community (thought partners, not just followers)
- Focus on execution, not just ideas (case studies > claims)
- Maintain authentic voice (competitors can't fake this)

**Contingency:**
- If competitors launch similar benchmarks: Release new benchmark with better methodology
- If others claim 99% accuracy: Publish head-to-head comparison
- If ideas get copied: Stay 2-3 months ahead with next iteration
