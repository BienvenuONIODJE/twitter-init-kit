## Task Execution Methodology

This twitter-init-kit project treats Twitter growth like engineering: **structured sprints, clear ownership, shipping criteria**.

### The PDCA Loop (2-Week Sprint Cycle)

- **Plan (Monday, Week 1)**: Define "Sprint Narrative" (e.g., "Focus on accuracy value prop"), draft core threads, identify "Hero Feature" to demo
- **Do (Week 1-2)**: Execute content calendar, run outreach, ship growth triggers
- **Check (Friday, Week 2)**: Review metrics. Did "Accuracy" narrative drive higher conversion than previous narrative?
- **Act (Weekend)**: Update spec.md with learnings. Kill underperforming formats. Double down on winners for next sprint.

### Experiment Framework

Each hypothesis follows this structure:

**Hypothesis:** If we [action], then [target audience] will [behavior change] because [reason].

**Example:** If we publish Finance Agent Benchmark, then Wall Street analysts will share it with teams and request demos, because benchmarks are proof points in institutional evaluation.

**Success Criteria:**
- Primary Metric: [Key metric] Target: [Number]
- Secondary Metric: [Supporting metric] Target: [Number]

**Decision Framework:**
- 🟢 **SCALE** (do more of this): If primary metric exceeds target by 20%+
- 🟡 **ADJUST** (modify approach): If primary metric is 80-120% of target
- 🔴 **KILL** (stop this): If primary metric is <80% of target for 2+ weeks

## Risk Mitigation Tasks

### Risk 1: Benchmark Contested or Criticized

**Mitigation Tasks:**
- [ ] T080 Make methodology completely transparent and peer-reviewable (publish detailed methodology document)
- [ ] T081 Prepare detailed response addressing common critiques (FAQ document)
- [ ] T082 Have academic advisors review benchmark (Week 2)
- [ ] T083 Plan quarterly updates to address feedback (Week 8, Week 11)

**Contingency:**
- If benchmark is criticized: Publish "Benchmark Methodology Q&A" post (T084)
- If accuracy is disputed: Offer independent verification by third party (T085)
- If competitors claim higher accuracy: Publish head-to-head evaluation (T086)

### Risk 2: Low Demo Conversion from Twitter Traffic

**Mitigation Tasks:**
- [ ] T087 Ensure Twitter CTAs align with audience needs (Demo vs. Trial - test both)
- [ ] T088 Test different CTAs (A/B across similar audiences)
- [ ] T089 Make demo booking frictionless (direct link in bio)
- [ ] T090 Track source of demo requests carefully (UTM parameters)

**Contingency:**
- If conversion <10%: Review CTA messaging, adjust to audience preference (T091)
- If conversion <5%: Pivot strategy away from direct CTAs toward content/community (T092)
- If conversion 0%: Question whether Twitter is right channel (pivot to LinkedIn) (T093)

### Risk 3: Founder Burnout (Too Much Content)

**Mitigation Tasks:**
- [ ] T094 Set realistic cadence: 5-7 posts weekly, 3-5 replies daily max
- [ ] T095 Batch content creation (2-3 hours on Sunday for entire week)
- [ ] T096 Get support from team (social media manager handles replies while Frank writes)
- [ ] T097 Schedule tweets to spread load across time zones

**Contingency:**
- If burnout signals appear: Reduce posting to 3-4x weekly, focus on quality (T098)
- If consistency drops: Hire social media manager to handle replies (T099)
- If quality degrades: Take 1-2 weeks off, maintain only high-value posts (T100)

### Risk 4: Competitive Response

**Mitigation Tasks:**
- [ ] T101 Own "reliability-driven AI" narrative early (hard for others to copy)
- [ ] T102 Build defensible moat through community (thought partners, not just followers)
- [ ] T103 Focus on execution, not just ideas (case studies > claims)
- [ ] T104 Maintain authentic voice (competitors can't fake this)

**Contingency:**
- If competitors launch similar benchmarks: Release new benchmark with better methodology (T105)
- If others claim 99% accuracy: Publish head-to-head comparison (T106)
- If ideas get copied: Stay 2-3 months ahead with next iteration (T107)
